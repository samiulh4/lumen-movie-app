1)
composer require lcobucci/jwt "^3.4.6"

2)
create a new folder called jwt in project's root directory
Inside the jwt folder, create two empty files: private.pem and public.pem.
These files will be used to generate and validate JWT tokens.

3)
Open the bootstrap/app.php file in your Lumen project.
Uncomment the line that loads the Dotenv variables:

Add the following code at the bottom of the bootstrap/app.php file to configure the JWT settings:
php
Copy code
$app->configure('jwt');
$app->register(App\Providers\AuthServiceProvider::class);

Create the JWT configuration file:

In your project's root directory, create a new folder called config.
Inside the config folder, create a new file called jwt.php.
Open the jwt.php file and add the following configuration:

<?php

return [
    'secret' => env('JWT_SECRET'),
    'keys' => [
        'private' => storage_path('jwt/private.pem'),
        'public' => storage_path('jwt/public.pem'),
    ],
];


To install JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in a Lumen project, you can follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to your Lumen project's root directory.
Run the following command to install the lcobucci/jwt package:
bash
Copy code
composer require lcobucci/jwt
Create a new folder for JWT keys (optional):

In your project's root directory, create a new folder called jwt.
Inside the jwt folder, create two empty files: private.pem and public.pem. These files will be used to generate and validate JWT tokens.
Configure the JWT settings:

Open the bootstrap/app.php file in your Lumen project.
Uncomment the line that loads the Dotenv variables:
php
Copy code
Dotenv::load(__DIR__.'/../');
Add the following code at the bottom of the bootstrap/app.php file to configure the JWT settings:
php
Copy code
$app->configure('jwt');
$app->register(App\Providers\AuthServiceProvider::class);
Create the JWT configuration file:

In your project's root directory, create a new folder called config.
Inside the config folder, create a new file called jwt.php.
Open the jwt.php file and add the following configuration:
php
Copy code
<?php

return [
    'secret' => env('JWT_SECRET'),
    'keys' => [
        'private' => storage_path('jwt/private.pem'),
        'public' => storage_path('jwt/public.pem'),
    ],
];
Update the .env file:

Open the .env file in your project's root directory.
Add the following line to set the JWT secret:
makefile
Copy code
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

On Windows (using Git Bash):
bash
Copy code
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\r\n'
